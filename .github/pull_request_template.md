<details><summary>These might include:</summary>

- bugs that need fixing (does it work as expected? and does it work with other code
  that it is likely to interact with?)
- alternative methods (could it be written more efficiently or with more clarity?)
- documentation improvements (does the documentation reflect how the code actually works?)
- additional tests that should be implemented
  - Do the tests effectively assure that it
  works correctly? Are there additional edge cases/ negative tests to be considered?
